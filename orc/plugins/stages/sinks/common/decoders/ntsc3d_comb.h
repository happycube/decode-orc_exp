// The chroma of one frame from it and up to two frames either side.
//
// A frame comb takes a still picture's chroma exactly (NTSC's subcarrier
// inverts from one frame to the next), where a 2D comb mistakes fine luma
// for chroma; on moving picture it leaves dots, and the 2D comb is right. So
// for each sample this decides how still the picture is, against which
// neighbours, and whether a frame comb is needed there at all:
//
// - Still: the low-frequency luma change from each neighbour against a noise
//   floor. The floor is the picture's own (the quietest frame pair's 25th
//   percentile) held to 0.5..2 times the disc's, measured on the sync tip,
//   which motion cannot touch; it rises with the local chroma-band
//   amplitude, by a slope measured between frames of the same chroma phase
//   and held to the colour burst's.
// - Averaged against both neighbours where both are still, or the picture
//   moves steadily (the frame is the mean of its neighbours, and of the
//   frames two away), as long as the two frame combs agree; against one
//   still neighbour otherwise, if the frame beyond it (the current frame's
//   chroma phase) matches in the chroma band.
// - No frame comb where the current frame is a flash: the frames either side
//   match each other and the current frame matches neither frame two away,
//   or the frames two away match each other far better than the current
//   frame matches either.
// - Only where needed: where the 2D comb's chroma inverts cleanly from line
//   to line, as chroma does, the 2D comb is as right and smoother (a frame
//   comb keeps the luma's noise near the subcarrier as a fine dot pattern);
//   and only where the frames two away confirm the detail stays.
// - The weights are smoothed along the line, so the output never switches
//   between combs from one sample to the next.
//
// Elsewhere the 2D comb is FractionalComb, a line comb along each edge's own
// slope.
//
// Thread safety: stateless; separate() may run on several threads at once.
